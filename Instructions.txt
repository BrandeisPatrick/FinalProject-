Checkers Instructions

Checkers is a game for two players. Each player has 12 of their own checkers that are 
arranged on opposite sides of the board start. Checkers can only move diagonally through
the squares, not up, down, or side to side. As a regular checker, you can't move backwards either

The goal of the game is to eat all of your opponents checkers first. 
You can do this by jumping over an opponents checker. Here are the rules for jumping:
1. The spot you are jumping to must be open
2. You can only jump over an enemy checker, not your own checkers
3. You can do a double jump move if there are two enemy checkers aligned in a row, with empty
spaces between them, so that your checker can jump to the empty spaces.
4. you can also do a zig zag move in which after the first jump, you jump perpendicularly over another
enemy checker. Same rules for double jump apply here.
5. If one of you checkers makes it to the opposite side of the board, it will be crowned a king.
Kings can move both forwards and backwards on the board. They also have two lives and will turn into 
a regular checker if an enemy checker jumps over them.

How to use this simulation:
When it's your turn, enter the spot of the checker you want to move and the spot you want
to move it to, seperated by a space.
For example: to move a checker from C1 to D2, type "C1 D2"


Ok, lets play!
