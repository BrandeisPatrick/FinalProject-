# FinalProject-
Update: 
If you guys want to see some cool things. 

Launch PlayGame_cheatcode version instead of that regular one (who wants it anyway)

The cheatcode are as follows:

ababcd: turn all play X's checkers to KingCheckers 

blacksheep: allow Play X's to move random 0-3 steps each turn (there is a chance that you might not be able to move)
                                                              (big risk and big reward)

Enjoy the cheatcode version. This is newly developed, so there might be some bugs untested. (sorry!!!)
